 ViPER - A Video Performance Evaluation Resource
   A tool in three parts:
     gt  - A Tool for Ground Truthing
     pe  - A Utility for Evaluation
     viz - A Set of Scripts to View the Results

 This ViPER-Light distribution only includes gt and pe. The viz tools 
currently require perl, a unix environment, and a lot of hacking.

   ************************************************************************

 Installing ViPER-Light

1. Download the viper-light package from:
     http://viper-toolkit.sourceforge.net/

2. Unzip the package into the directory you wish to install the 
   package. An example is "C:/Program File/ViPER/" on Windows.

3. Drag the icon for viper-gt.jar to your start menu or desktop,
   creating a shortcut to it, if you wish.

4. Double-click on the shortcut, if you created it. Otherwise, double-
   click the icon for viper-gt.jar directly. (If you wish, the command
   line argument, from the install directory, is "java -jar viper-gt.jar"
   or "javaw -jar viper-gt.jar" if you don't wish to have command output.)

 Using ViPER-Light

  viper-gt
    This command starts the Ground Truth software. It requires a recent (>
1.4) version of java to be installed on the computer. This tool allows the
user  to mark up a media file with information about its content. This
information is stored in a truth file, normally with the extension .xml.
    The truth file must (currently) be created in a text editor or be one 
of the templates included with the software. The media file must be either 
an mpeg or a .info file, which may list several images or movies.
    For more information, see:
  http://viper-toolkit.sourceforge.net/docs/


  viper-pe <various options>
    "viper-pe" is a command line utility which will evaluate how well a set 
of "result" media metadata against a set of "truth" metadata, presumably 
generated by viper-gt or a similar tool. It generates two forms of output:
the default, human readable format, and the perl-readable raw format.
    This command takes a large number of arguments. For information on it, 
see the viper/pe/docs directory, or the manual in the viper/common/docs
directory
