* Gt Annotation Guidelines *

For each event the following descriptors are considered:
-Framespan (initial_frame:final_frame)
-BoundingBox (location)


Events types:
-PutObject: since the object is left until it is removed or the end of the sequence
-AbandonedObject: since the abandon conditions are met until the object is removed or the end of the sequence

Abandon conditions:
First level:
	-Temporal condition: the object must be stationary, at least, for 30 seconds
Second level:
	-Spatial condition: object's owner should not be in the surroundings


Each event is associated to a single object. 
Each object has a unique id. 
A single object can/must be associated with both events type (PutObject and AbandonedObject).
